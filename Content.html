            <p>Hi. My name is Bebe Bavongkhoun.</p>
            <p>But online, i mainly identify myself by my Alias, Poji.</p>
            <p>Or even Duck Wizard when im serious.</p>
            <p>Though as unserious these names seem, they are fun and/or funny and that perfectly describes me and i take that very seriously.</p>
            <p>
                So seriously in fact, I hope that the day I become a serious success, I will have the power to deconstruct
                our system of professionalism to become more people friendly. Because where the world is today, 
                it is a serious problem with how much wasted potential there is out there and industries are just ignoring them.
            </p>
            <p>
                Talent, pure talent, doesn't always speak in an eloquent way. In fact, most of it just goes right over
                corporate minds, because of what experiences curated them to become. Tunnel vision. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I want to show the world that even from the bottom of the barrel, lie hidden treasures that only those 
                who know from struggles, adaptation, and unorthodox thinking comes amazing innovations that changes futures
                and paths.
            </p>
            <p>
                Allow me to show you and motivate you to unlease your inner talents. To become more than someone who just
                goes in and out of work, back home, eat and sleep, just to relax for 2 days all just to repeat that over 
                and over again until you retire at 69.

        <div class='InfoSheet' id="InfoSheetRoblox">
            <p>This project began around December 2024.
            </p>
            <p id="InfoSheetRobloxSmaller1">
                (when i had a little accident that ultimately costed me my 
                minimum wage job. which i didn't lose solely by my own responsibilities. I blame that on the hospitals
                and ShareCare for their extremely careless people and systems for not communicating with each other to fill
                out paperwork.)
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, it's far from complete, but as a solo developer I feel the progress made within just 2 months and the
                quality of gameplay it contains speaks volumes for how much more i can do in a year if i wasn't in the situation 
                i am in right now.
            </p>
            <p>
                And to me, this project was only a learning experience, a prototype, but one that plan to turn into a
                full blown product.
            </p>
            <p>
                Games today have gone stale. The new games coming out are just rehashes of previous games. I want to bring 
                something that at least, feels new and is genuinely FUN. No unreasonable difficulty or some lame power gap
                to prevents players from progressing because of some exponently scaled stat. Progression should be made because
                of an individuals skills. Or for the less skilled, commitment to a grind to build a weapon perfect for certain scenarios 
                through the use of this games developing crafting system.
            </p>
            <p>
                And speaking of a crafting system. You know the generic "crafting system" that pretty much grinds down to just 
                getting a bigger number for your health or damage? Just, no. that's boring. That's lazy programming. In fact, i can't
                even call that programming if the progression is so dang simple. It's stupid and i think it holds humanity back.
                With any increase to something, there should be trade-offs. At least something to equalize those benefits if such power
                is to be obtained, but ofcourse there will be progression that will make the game easier just like in life the
                more one practices their particular trade.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, what is this game you might be wondering? It's a horde shooter done right. The enemies will be coded in a 
                way that produces emergent behavior to prevent predictabilities like, lining up for perfect colaterals, no merging
                with one another because they dont collide with each other, latency or server issues won't be a hinderance to the fun making you miss shots, 
                and certainly no path finding that jerks their positions back and forth to weave through shots because they seemingly take advantage of the 
                digital worlds unnatural way of movement.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is a game that will be built with the idea of scalability and modularity so that as a solo developer,
                I can easily add content and updates as fast as possible. Like, on demand.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently what mechanics are featured is an object placement system akin to uglyburger0's 3008 game (not stolen mind you,
                i had to nearly build my own system from the ground up), and a unique gun crafting system that allows for one to dissassemble
                and reassemble in any order and placement the player chooses. Soon i'll complete the next part of that crafting system
                to allow players to modify the shape of each of those individual parts that will affect the performance of their assembled weapon.
            </p>
            <p>
                but before that, I need to convert the enemy npcs to client-side so that i can better control how much lag players 
                would receive. Oh yeah, and lag or server performance will actually be a part of the gameplay. Because the theme of
                this game will conveniently revolve around computer qualities.
            </p>
            <p>
                For now, i hope the game can be enjoyed as is while i work on other unrelated issues preventing me from prioritize
                development of this game.

        <div class='InfoSheet' id="InfoSheetAI">
            <p>
                Another solo project of mine is a Python based AGI alternative to the mainstream programs.
                i won't say exactly how and why it works but i can say what is wrong with what's in the public.
            </p>
            <p>
                Well, maybe not exactly what is wrong but i do have a pretty good idea why they aren't good enough to
                be called, amazing. When teams work on collaborative projects, there comes moments when ideas clash.
                And even when everyone agrees upon standards or paradigms there are still slightly different interpretations
                per individual. This inevitably turns parts of the project into a blackbox for everyone not involved and sections
                not coded by contributors becomes foreign territory only understood to a "good enough" degree. But that isn't the biggest issue.
                It's the part where the code becomes so abstracted it blends all definitions and concepts into a metaphorical 
                grey blob. Such an AI will never truly understand the complexities of how humans define the world around us and it's
                objects.
            </p>

            <p>
                On top of that, it becomes even more complicated when concepts without a tangible physical form doesn't have a 
                standing for explanation because ideas are simply theories even if we can prove them from every angle possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                Don't get me wrong, the people who created machine learning and computer neural networks are amazingly smart and maybe
                even way out of my depth, but there is still that trend of people with big brains being unable to dumb things down
                to the simple man. Without a way to translate the complexities of existance itself, Their AI will never reach that
                Movie esk level of true-ness. Accuracy will always be around that 99.99% and that just isn't enough. 100% sounds 
                immpossible but i'm would like to boldly claim, it is possible. And all it takes a little humanity for our new up
                coming robotic friends.

                Yes, this portfolio site isn't the flashiest out of all the thousand others with crazy transitions and 
                fancy navigations, but understand i didn't use some premade template or automated website creator. This was built
                from scratch.
            </p>

            <p>
                The design is pretty much made out of preference, simple, fast, and clean. I just like things to be easy. Easy to navigate, easy to understand.
                Redundancy just makes things confusing and misleads people. I've always hated those kind of websites with multiple leads that never guides anybody
                to information they need to find. It just all becomes bloat.

        <div class='InfoSheet' id="InfoSheetPython">
            <p>
                somewhere in 2018 Python was my first stepping stone into coding. And i didn't start small. I knew right away what i wanted to make and that was an AI assistant.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Instead of a neural network, it ultilizes a kind of pseudocode that works as a procedural list of instructions that helps define what kind of idea
                each block is. Be it a macro process that gathers sub-processes to act as a state machine or a linked list to help with context information. Or 
                possibly a dictionary to help differentiate between definitions that describe the one phrase. And when new pointers are needed, or an alien concept
                is introduced, one of those process would code that for itself.
            </p>

            <p>
                Currently though, it is only a working model. some processes still need to be manually coded (through the pseudocode not in the python language).
                What's great is that all the hard stuff is done. Everything from keyboard/mouse input events to camera work and object recognition is set.
                The only thing i could say is missing is audio input. But for my own personal use reading text is just fine.
